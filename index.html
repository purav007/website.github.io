                     <p>My name is Purav Patel and am male. I am 16 years old, studying in Shree Baghubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic.
                        I was born in a small village where I grew up.After high school, I joined JKUAT a famous university in Kenya where I studied Bachelor of Science in Information and technology.
                        I was employed in 2009 until 2013 when I quit to become a freelancer.I am a go getter and donâ€™t let anything come in my way.
                        If I set my mind toward achieving something I push it until I have my goals.
                        I like taking risks and when I quit my job as an ICT officer to become a freelancer, many people thought I had lost my mind.</p>
